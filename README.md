# Time-Translator

TimeTranslator

This educational app is available in the App Store in English and German. Choose a scenario, set your desired run time, and experience the events of that scenario in your own time. Topics currently include science and history, and may expand in the future.

I built TimeTranslator for my clients, who have been dreaming of this app for two years. The clients provide the content for the app, and they maintain the api that houses the data. I focused primarily on the functionality of the app, developing complex data models and methods to display a series of timed events within the user's selected timeframe.

Now that the app has been launched, our clients are focusing on creating more content, and I am continuing to make updates as needed. We have a growing list of possible new features that we will begin working on as soon as the clients are ready to take those next steps.

More info will be posted here soon!
